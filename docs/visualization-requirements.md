# Visualization Requirements — ClinicalAlertSystem

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the visualization requirements for **ClinicalAlertSystem**.

The goal is to identify which system metrics and events should be visualized in order to:
- Monitor patient room temperatures
- Track alerts and their severity
- Observe system behavior under load

The initial visualization will be implemented as a **Streamlit-based prototype**, with the intent to later evolve into a full-stack monitoring dashboard.

---

## 2. Target Audience

- Developers working on ClinicalAlertSystem
- Reviewers evaluating system observability
- Operators monitoring alert activity (simulated)

---

## 3. Data Sources

### Current (Phase 7)
- **Structured Java logs**
  - Generated by `TemperatureSensorTask`
  - Generated by `NotificationDispatcher`
  - Written to a log file

### Future (Out of Scope)
- REST API
- WebSocket / Server-Sent Events
- Metrics endpoint (Prometheus-compatible)

---

## 4. Metrics to Visualize

### 4.1 Temperature Monitoring

**Metrics**
- Current temperature per room
- Temperature trend over time

**Source**
- Log events with type `TEMP_READING`

**Why it matters**
- Detect abnormal conditions
- Provide historical context before alerts

---

### 4.2 Alert Monitoring

**Metrics**
- Active alerts
- Alert severity levels (HIGH, CRITICAL)
- Alert frequency over time

**Source**
- Log events:
  - `ALERT_CREATED`
  - `ALERT_DISPATCHED`
  - `ALERT_DROPPED`

**Why it matters**
- Identify critical situations quickly
- Verify alert prioritization
- Observe alert system load

---

### 4.3 System Health (Optional / Stretch)

**Metrics**
- Alert queue depth
- Alerts processed per unit time

**Source**
- Derived from logs
- Future metrics instrumentation

**Why it matters**
- Detect backpressure
- Validate concurrency behavior

---

## 5. Visualization Requirements

The visualization prototype should provide:

- A **live alert feed**
- A **temperature overview per room**
- A **severity distribution view**
- Periodic refresh without restarting the app

The visualization must be:
- Read-only
- Non-intrusive
- Decoupled from backend logic

---

## 6. Non-Goals

This phase explicitly does NOT include:
- Alert acknowledgment
- Configuration changes
- Authentication
- Persistent storage
- Production deployment

---

## 7. Evolution Path

This visualization prototype is a stepping stone toward:
- A REST-based backend
- Real-time streaming (WebSockets / SSE)
- A full frontend application (e.g. React)
- Integration with monitoring tools (Grafana, Prometheus)

---

## 8. Summary

This document establishes a clear, minimal, and extensible set of visualization requirements to support:
- System observability
- Debugging
- Demonstration of concurrency and alert prioritization

It intentionally prioritizes clarity and extensibility over feature completeness.
